I received a PhD in Computer Sciences and Information Technologies from the University of Granada in 2013. 

I am currently a tenured researcher at Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dellâ€™Informazione "A. Faedo", which is part of the National Research Council (CNR). 

My research interests include learning to quantify, deep learning, and representation learning.
